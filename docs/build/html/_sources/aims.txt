Aims
====

The initial aim is to automate each stage so that it is easy to return
to a partially processed directory and be able to review and pick up
again with minimal effort.

A secondary aim is to automate the process of examining data to
uncover relationships between data files, understand and annotate the
contents, and safely remove files that are no longer required.
