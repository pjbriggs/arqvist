arqvist: explore & curate NGS data
==================================

Aims
****

The initial aim is to automate each stage so that it is easy to return
to a partially processed directory and be able to review and pick up
again with minimal effort.

A secondary aim is to automate the process of examining data to
uncover relationships between data files, understand and annotate the
contents, and safely remove files that are no longer required.

Dependencies
************

Depends on the ``genomics-bcftbx`` and ``auto_process_ngs`` modules.

To create test data use the ``make_mock_solid_dir.py`` utility from the
``genomics`` repo.
